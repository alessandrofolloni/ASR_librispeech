# ASR_librispeech
Dataset: libri speech https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/librispeech <br>


Preprocessing: spectrograms starting from the file audios <br>




Project for the course: implementation of different architectures studied during the lectures, e.g. RNNs, CNNs varying number of layers, overall architecture.




Project work: deeper study on the problem trying to implement attention mechanisms using Transformers, e.g. insertion of a pre-trained LLM as a decoder and comparison of the performance, word piece models ecc


Metrics: WER and CER

Loss: CTC
